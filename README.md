# CheckeredDecksPlus
I made every 2 suit checkered deck (and also ones where there's 52 cards of one suit) because just spades + hearts is boring.

How to unlock:
-Checkered Decks: unlocked with the regular checkered deck by winning with black deck
-Suit Decks: unlocked by winning on ***REGULAR*** checkered deck
